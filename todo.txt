1. Setup optimisation:
_initial and boundary conditions that could help reduce the amplitude of the oscillations

2. Data analysis:
_export the density and velocity radial profiles over time
_show that the system converges to a steady state, maybe confirm that the oscillations are just sound waves

3. Physics check: 
_compare your solutions to the predicted non-self-gravitating and stable self-gravitating profiles
_confirm that a shock form when you predict no self-gravitating equilibrium
