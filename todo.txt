_Define optimal settings: grid (boundaries, type of grid, resolution), integration scheme (solver, timestepping,...), boundary conditions (X1_BEG & X1_END, RHO & VX1)
_Enable data analysis: adapt the data exportation method to visualize the evolution of the system (radial profiles over time, density & velocity), prepare a script to read these files, verify the quality of the results and produce figures
_include the gas mass in the gravitational potential by radial integration, check
